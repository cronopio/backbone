Backbone supplies structure to JavaScript-heavy applications by providing models key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing application over a RESTful JSON interface.

FORK INFO

In this fork from Backbone.js you can find a rewrite of sync() method for using with http://socket.io, emitting some events.

As you imagine using Socket.io we dont need define `url` on our models, only the model name is needed.

In the server side you can add callbacks for events with names as `model`:`action`:`type` where:

 - `model` is the name of your Backbone.Model
 - `action` can be `create`,`update`,`delete`,`read` and `index`
 - `type` can be `_response` for cases when you need send some info returning to Backbone or can be `error` reporting the action fail.
 
Well, now you image this. When the server do the action as you request, what if the server can send a message for tell other clients that some Model change and reload the changes? hum? Thats why I rewrite sync().
